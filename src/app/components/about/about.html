      <p>
        V4 DevLabs is a forward-thinking tech startup focused on innovation, product development, and real-world
        problem-solving through technology. Founded with a vision to build meaningful solutions and create a community
        of skilled developers, V4 DevLabs operates at the intersection of development, training, and entrepreneurship.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of this vision, we launched <strong>V4 Code Academy</strong> — a learning initiative under V4 DevLabs
        dedicated to empowering students with practical coding skills. Unlike traditional education systems that focus
        on theory, V4 Code Academy is built around real-world projects, hands-on experience, and industry-relevant tools.
