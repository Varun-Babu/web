      <p class="lead">
        V4 DevLabs is an early-stage product startup building practical software for the civil & transport industries.
        Our flagship product, <strong>NextBrick</strong>, is a marketplace that connects clients with vetted builders and
        service providers — fast, transparent and reliable.

      <p class="muted">
        NextBrick also includes a free project-management module for companies to track work, attendance, expenses and
        progress — enabling small and mid-sized firms to manage projects without heavy tooling costs.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        We also operate <strong>V4 Code Academy</strong> campus hubs where B.Tech students learn by building: students
        design apps, complete certification sprints, and access internship pathways into product teams.

      <h2 class="section-title">Our <span class="accent">Vision</span></h2>

      <p class="lead">
        Create a trusted digital marketplace that connects clients with quality builders, and provide builders with
        lean tools to plan and scale work. Simultaneously, make engineering education project-first so graduates are
        ready to ship products from day one.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        We believe better tools and better-trained people will reduce rework, improve timelines, and raise career
        outcomes for students entering the workforce.

      <h2 class="section-title">Our <span class="accent">Mission</span></h2>

      <p class="lead">
        Build two complementary systems: a marketplace that reliably matches clients with builders, and a practical,
        no-cost project-management platform that companies can use to run projects, log expenses and track attendance.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        Through V4 Code Academy hubs, we train students to contribute to product development and accelerate their
        transition into internships or product roles within months of completing a hub sprint.
